**At this event, you can expect to meet our members, including many of its Steering and Management Committee members, and network with fellow data 
protection scholars in an informal setting, as well as engage in an open discussion about what such a network can do for members in order to facilitate 
their work in the field of data protection.**

The DPSN is a network that aims at facilitating academic exchanges between international researchers working in the field of data protection law, 
in Europe and beyond. Open to all researchers, it focuses on supporting exchanges between early-stage academics from all over Europe; encouraging 
diversity; advancing the bridges between data protection scholarship of all continents; promoting the study of data protection law in Europe and beyond.
