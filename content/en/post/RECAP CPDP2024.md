DPSN achieved great success at the 2024 Computer, Privacy, and Data Protection Conference (CPDP) 
with an innovative and engaging event format: the Ultimate Data Protection CPDP Quiz. 
This quiz drew in over 80 participants, leading them on an immersive journey through the world of data protection, 
featuring a wide array of over 40 data protection-related questions.

The event was designed to mimic a TV show, with Romain Robert (EDPS) serving as the charismatic conductor and expert quizmasters Jef Ausloos (IViR) 
and Gloria Gonz√°lez Fuster (VUB) ensuring that all the rules were meticulously followed. 
The top six scorers were then invited to engage in a lively battle of GDPR charades, adding an entertaining and competitive element to the event.

Not only was the quiz intellectually stimulating, but it also provided ample opportunities for networking and socializing. 
Participants were able to connect with like-minded individuals in the field and exchange valuable insights. 
The event also featured an awards ceremony to recognize the top performers, as well as the provision of refreshing drinks and an enjoyable 
atmosphere for all participants.

The Ultimate Data Protection CPDP Quiz offered a unique blend of education, entertainment, and networking, creating a memorable and enriching experience 
for everyone involved.
