On 28 January 2022, coinciding with the international Data Protection Day, the DPSN will organise the first ever international quick meet-up of data protection law researchers.
 
We want to create a platform for people to get to know each other’s work better. With this in mind, we are calling for expressions of interest to do very short presentations of your research – be it your developing PhD, interesting master thesis, upcoming promising paper or brand new project. All levels of seniority are welcome, the only requirement being to be open to listen to others in a rigorous yet friendly spirit.
 
**What?**
A concise presentation (maximum 5 minutes, and 3 slides maximum) to be followed by a very concise Q&A.
 
**When?**
On Friday 28 January 2022, 13:00-15:00 Brussels time
 
**Where?**
Online.
 
**How can I participate?**
Please send your name, affiliation, the title of your presentation, a very short abstract (maximum 2 sentences) and 6 keywords (e.g. GDPR, EU Charter, purpose limitation, data subject rights, DPIAs, DPOs, DPAs, enforcement, data transfers, damages, LED, etc.) to dpsn@posteo.eu before 11th January 2022. **Submissions are now closed**.
 
We look forward to hearing from you!
