If you are interested in staying up-to-date on the latest judgments of the EU Court of Justice, 
do not miss the monthly digital coffee event co-organised by DPSN and LSTS VUB.

Join us for an informal exchange of ideas and insights as we discuss the most interesting 1-2 judgments on the agenda at the CJEU in the past
month. This is an excellent opportunity to stay informed about the latest developments in data protection.

Whether you are an academic, a legal professional, a data protection officer, or simply interested in this topic, 
we welcome you to join us for this exciting event.

**In November, we will discuss the CJEU judgment C-768/21 (Land Hessen), on the obligation of DPAs to exercise corrective powers under Article 58(2)
GDPR. The CJEU ruled that the GDPR does not impose an obligation on the DPAs to use corrective measure every time a breach of personal data is found.**

The case will be introduced by Maria Magierska (Maastricht University)

We are meeting on Monday, November 27th, at 1.30 pm CET via Teams. Please register [here](https://events.teams.microsoft.com/event/10bf500e-a955-4920-b9f9-3c6cf8e57d51@695b7ca8-2da8-4545-a2da-42d03784e585)
