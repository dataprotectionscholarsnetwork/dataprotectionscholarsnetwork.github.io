** The Data Protection Law Scholars Network (DPSN) participates with a booth at the 2022 EDPS Conference "The Future of Data Protection: Effective Enforcement in the Digital World"! **

The event takes place on 16 & 17 June 2022 in Brussels. The venue of the EDPS conference is The Egg (Rue Barastraat, 175 1070 Brussels, Belgium) and is open to registered participants.
When and where can you find our booth? We will be present both days at the riverside area of The Egg! We will have flyers and limited edition stickers for you! Do not miss the opportunity to get to know our work and have your say about the network's next steps.
You will also have the chance to meet many members of our steering and management committees who are speaking, moderating or attending.
We are looking forward to meet you!
