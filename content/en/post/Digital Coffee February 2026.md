Join DPSN and LSTS-VUB for our next Digital Coffee, where we’ll take a closer look at recent CJEU developments in data protection law and, above all, discuss them together.

These sessions are not lectures but open conversations. The idea is simple: bring your perspectives, questions, and doubts. 
It’s a space to exchange views, debate interpretations, and collectively reflect on where EU data protection law is heading. So, grab a coffee (or your favourite infusion), 
turn on your camera if you like, and join the discussion.
 
**This time, we’ll focus on the forthcoming judgment in WhatsApp Ireland Ltd v European Data Protection Board (C-97/23 P).** 
The case addresses whether companies can bring a direct action for annulment before the EU courts against a binding EDPB decision adopted under the GDPR’s consistency mechanism, 
and whether such decisions constitute challengeable acts that directly affect their legal position. It is the appeal against the General Court’s ruling in WhatsApp v EDPB (T-709/21).
 
With the judgment expected on 10 February 2026, this Digital Coffee offers a timely opportunity to unpack its implications while they are still fresh. If you’d like to prepare in advance, 
you can read the Opinion of AG Ćapeta here.
 
The case will be introduced by Dr. Lorenzo Dalla Corte (Assistant Professor in Data Protection and Cybersecurity Law at TILT).
 
**When: Wednesday, 11 February, 13:30–14:15 CET**

**Where: Online MS Teams**
