### **Call for participants: the third DPSN International Data Protection Day work-in-progress online event (19 January 2024)** ###

Would you like to share your research with fellow data protection academics worldwide? 

Do it together with the DPSN community!

![DPSN Annual Event Poster](https://github.com/dataprotectionscholarsnetwork/dataprotectionscholarsnetwork.github.io/assets/116156905/6b6b42a8-bfbf-42a7-bad0-6283abe76dfc)


One of our network’s missions is to create a platform for people to get to know each other’s work better. The previous International Researchers Online Meet-up events brought together more than 150 data protection law scholars worldwide. 
We are once again calling for expressions of interest to do very short presentations of your research – be it your developing PhD, interesting master thesis, upcoming promising paper, or brand-new project. All levels of seniority are welcome, the only requirement being the willingness to engage with others in rigorous yet friendly spirits.

The participants will be asked to make a short presentation of a maximum of 5 minutes using no more than 3 slides. A short Q&A session of 5 minutes will follow each presentation. 

**To participate in the January 2024 event, please send:**

1.	Your (the presenter’s) name (please provide the name of all authors if you intend to present a co-authored paper or other work),
2.	Your affiliation (please provide the affiliation information of all authors if you intend to present a co-authored paper or other work), 
3.	The title of your presentation, 
4.	A very short abstract (maximum 2 sentences) and 6 keywords (e.g., health data, encryption, international transfers)

**to dpsn@posteo.eu before 23:59 CET on December 18th, 2023!***

**If you did not send your application before the deadline but are still interested, try to send it after the date and you will be added to the waiting list.*


**Please be notified that the applications that fail to include all the required information shall not be considered.**
Given the high number of applicants we received in the previous years and the limited number of presentations we can accommodate, we will prioritise applications with an emphasis on diversity (gender, nationality, institutional affiliation, previous presentation, etc.).

The selected presentations will be notified shortly after the closure of the registrations, and the presenters will be asked **to provide their 3 slides on January 12th at noon CET at the latest.** 

**Due to practical limitations,the presenters who fail to submit their slides by this deadline will be removed from the program despite the confirmation email they receive.**
