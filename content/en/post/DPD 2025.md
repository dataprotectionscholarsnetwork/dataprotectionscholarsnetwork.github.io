## **Call for participants** ##

One of our network’s missions is to create a platform for people to get to know each other’s work better. 
The previous International Researchers Online Meet-up events was extremely successful. With this in mind, 
we are once again calling for expressions of interest to do very short presentations of your research – be it your developing PhD, 
interesting master thesis, upcoming promising paper, or brand-new project. 

All levels of seniority are welcome, 
the only requirement being to be open to listening to others in a rigorous yet friendly spirit.
Like the previous International Researchers Online Meet-up events, the participants will be asked to give a short presentation of a maximum of 5 minutes using a maximum of 3 slides. 
A short Q&A session will follow each presentation. 

**To participate in the January 2025 event, please send:**

1.	Your (the presenter’s) name (please provide the name of all authors if you intend to present a co-authored paper or other work),
2.	Your affiliation (please provide the affiliation information of all authors if you intend to present a co-authored paper or other work), 
3.	The title of your presentation, 
4.	A very short abstract (maximum 2 sentences) and 6 keywords (e.g., risk assessments, data spaces, generative AI, legal basis of processing)
to dpscholars@protonmail.com. before ~December 18th, 2024~ **January 6th, 2024 (23:59 CET).** 

**Please be notified that the applications that fail to include all the required information shall not be considered.**

Given the high number of applicants we received in the previous years and the limited number of presentations we can accommodate, 
we may have to reject some of the applications to ensure diversity (gender, nationality, institutional affiliation, previous presentation etc.) among speakers and topics.
The selected presentations will be notified shortly after the closure of the registrations, 
and the presenters will be asked **to provide their 3 slides on January 17th at noon CET at the latest.** 

**Due to practical limitations, the presenters who fail to submit their slides by this deadline will be removed from the program despite the confirmation email they receive.**
