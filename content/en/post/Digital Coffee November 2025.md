Join DPSN and LSTS-VUB for our next Digital Coffee, where we’ll take a closer look at the latest CJEU judgments on data protection, and, most importantly, talk about it together.

These sessions are not lectures but genuine conversations. The idea is simple: we all bring our perspectives, questions, and thoughts to the table. It’s a space to share views, debate interpretations,
and reflect collectively on where EU data protection law is heading. So, get your coffee (or favourite infusion), turn on your camera if you like, and join the discussion.

This time, we’ll focus on the upcoming Inteligo Media judgment (C-654/23), which deals with the legal basis for newsletter distribution, direct marketing, and the ePrivacy Directive. 
The ruling is expected on 13 November 2025, giving us the perfect occasion to unpack it while it’s still fresh.
