The Brussels effect has become a buzzword with the development of global data protection standards in recent years. The Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL), 
China's counterpart to the GDPR, was also created under the EU’s regulatory gravity. After one and a half years of enforcement of the PIPL, 
questions have risen as to how well the imported regulatory tools have settled into China’s reality and how it has impacted the digital industry and individuals both domestic and global. 
Against the backdrop of the growing call for reform of the EU data protection law, how will China react to similar regulatory challenges such as the ineffectiveness of informed consent and the influence of the powerful internet giants? 

This panel aims to provide insights into these complex questions through the dialogue among Chinese and EU law experts. 

This seminar will last around 2 hours, featuring presentations of 4 speakers, follow-up discussion, and Q&A with the audience (30min).
