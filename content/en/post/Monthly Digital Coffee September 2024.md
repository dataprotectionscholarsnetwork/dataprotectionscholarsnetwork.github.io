Join us for an informal exchange of ideas and insights as we discuss the most interesting 1-2 judgments on the agenda at the CJEU in the past
month. This is an excellent opportunity to stay informed about the latest developments in data protection.

we welcome you to join us for this exciting event.

**In September, we will discuss the CJEU judgment C-757/22 Meta Platforms Ireland - Representative Action concerning the GDPR and class actions. 
The CJEU ruled that a breach of the controllerâ€™s information obligation can enable a representative action under Article 80(2) GDPR.** 

**The case will be introduced by Dr Francesca Episcopo (University of Amsterdam Law School).
We are meeting on Wednesday, September 25th, at 1.30 pm CET via Teams.**
