![DPSN eLaw Panel](https://github.com/dataprotectionscholarsnetwork/dataprotectionscholarsnetwork.github.io/assets/116156905/fbb1a1e0-9aab-4376-9838-1ff08cfe70fd)



DPSN will host a workshop at Leiden eLaw Conference - Law and/versus Technology: Trends for the New Decade.
The purpose of the workshop is to promote networking by providing an opportunity for data protection academics from around the world to share their research. 
The workshop will consist of two parts. In the first part, selected speakers will present their research. In the second part, we will have some drinks together allowing for informal discussions among all the participants. 
These discussions can be valuable for the network's mission of creating a community where people can learn more about each other's work.
 
In previous years, we organised several International Researchers Online Meet-up events, and we were pleased to have more than 150 data protection law scholars from around the globe attending our sessions. 
Although most of our events are online, we are excited to provide you with a great opportunity to showcase your research and meet each other in person during the Leiden eLaw Conference, which is happening soon!         **The workshop will be in person only.**
 
We are once again calling for expressions of interest to do very short presentations of your research – be it your developing PhD, interesting master thesis, upcoming promising paper, or brand-new project. 
All levels of seniority are welcome, the only requirement being the willingness to engage with others in rigorous yet friendly spirits.
Participants will be requested to deliver a concise presentation lasting up to 4 minutes, utilizing a maximum of 3 slides. 
While a formal Q&A session will not be conducted, we encourage the audience to pose their queries directly to the speakers during the informal drinks.


**To participate in the workshop,  please send by June 5th:**
1.	Your (the presenter’s) name (please provide the name of all authors if you intend to present a co-authored paper or other work),
2.	Your affiliation (please provide the affiliation information of all authors if you intend to present a co-authored paper or other work),
3.	The title of your presentation,
4.	A very short abstract (maximum 2 sentences) and 6 keywords (e.g., health data, encryption, international transfers)
**to dpscholars@protonmail.com**  
 
Please be notified that the applications that fail to include all the required information shall not be considered. 
Given the high number of applicants we received in the previous years and the limited number of presentations we can accommodate, we will prioritise applications with an emphasis on diversity (gender, nationality, institutional affiliation, previous presentation, etc.).


**The selected presentations will be notified on June 7th, and the presenters will be asked to provide their three slides on June 18th at the latest.**

**Please note that this call is only for those who registered or will be attending the Leiden symposium in person. DPSN is not involved with general registrations for the symposium and does not offer any waiver for the conference fee. 
Kindly keep this in mind if you decide to submit your application to us.**
