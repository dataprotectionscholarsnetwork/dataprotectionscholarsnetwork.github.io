### **On the 30th of January 2026 the Data Protection Law Scholars Network (DPSN) organises its fifth international meet-up of data protection law researchers. The event will take place online, between 13:30 and 15:30 Brussels time.** ###

## Format/What to expect ## 

Speakers were selected through a call for abstracts for concise presentations that the Network launched back in 2023.  
Data protection law scholars of all levels of seniority will present their current work in 3 slides and 5 minutes, followed by 3 minutes of Q&A. The programme encompasses 2 sessions, which consist of two parallel streams. 
Throughout the event, participants will be actively encouraged to engage with each other's work and network.  Register [here](https://tilburguniversity.zoom.us/meeting/register/5KbmopttROO4Eq-PaCWC6w#/registration)!
