## **On the 25th of May 2023, the Data Protection Law Scholars Network (DPSN) will participate at Computers, Privacy & Data Protection (CPDP) 2023** ###

This will be an in-person event scheduled for May 25th (Thursday) between 17:15 and 18:30 at M-Village Grande.

As you may have noticed, a couple of weeks ago we published a word cloud to solicit the active participation of our entire community and identify the most pressing issues in the academic world of data protection. Specifically, we classified them as follows:
* Issues of Early Career Researchers
* Interdisciplinarity and Methodology
* Diversity
* Global Perspectives
* Other issues / Free discussion

During the session, we will have five tables designated for the five topics mentioned above and will have an engaging discussion on these topics with colleagues from all over the world. 

Like in all our events, there will also be an element of networking in which we encourage our Network to get to know each other. 

Therefore, we would like to continue our conversations at the official cocktails that will start right after our workshop and would be happy to learn more about you and your research with drinks and bites in Brussels!

We really look forward to see you in person on Thursday!
