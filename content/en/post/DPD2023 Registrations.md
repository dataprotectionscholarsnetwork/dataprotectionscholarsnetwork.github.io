### **On the 27th of January 2023, coinciding with International Data Protection Day, the Data Protection Law Scholars Network (DPSN) organises its second international meet-up of data protection law researchers. The event will take place online, between 15:00 and 18:00 Brussels time.** ###

## Format/What to expect ## 

Speakers were selected through a call for abstracts for very short presentations that the Network launched back in 2022. As we wanted to give a forum to all relevant applicants to present, we decided to make the event an hour longer.  
Data protection law scholars of all levels of seniority will present in 3 slides and 5 minutes their current work. The programme encompasses 2 sessions which consist of two parallel streams each with an equal number of speakers. The 3rd and final session takes place in plenary. The streams are loosely thematically organised while still covering a diverse and innovative range of topics in data protection law. The programme has a further element of surprise, meaning that we will not announce the names of the speakers per session, but **attendees will be allocated randomly either to Parallel Stream 1 or to Parallel Stream 2.** Throughout the event, participants will be actively encouraged to engage with each other's work and network.  

## How can I register/attend the event? ##
The event is free to attend, but **registration is required**. You can register [here]( https://tilburguniversity.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJcufuugqTguGtWRddLzTCUx06mNBtr-jb6v  ).
*Registrations are open until 25 January 2023.*

After registration, you will receive:
