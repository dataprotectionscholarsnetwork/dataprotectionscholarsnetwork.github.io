## Call for partecipants: the second DPSN International Data Protection Day work-in-progress event will take place on Friday 27th January 2023 online ##

One of our network's missions is to create a platform for people to get to know each other's work better. With this in mind, we are once again calling for expressions of interest to do very short presentations of your research â€“ be it your developing PhD, interesting master thesis, upcoming promising paper, or brand-new project. All levels of seniority are welcome, the only requirement being to be open to listen to others in a rigorous yet friendly spirit.

Like in our previous event, which took place on 28th January 2022, participants will be asked to give a concise presentation of maximum 5 minutes and 3 slides. This will be followed by a very concise Q&A. The January 2022 event brought together more than 150 data protection law scholars from all over the world. 27 speakers, divided into two parallel sessions, gave short presentations on their current work. You can read a short summary of the event [here](https://dataprotectionscholars.network/post/data-protection-day-event/) 

To participate in the January 2023 event, please send your name, affiliation, the title of your presentation, a very short abstract (maximum 2 sentences) and 6 keywords (e.g. GDPR, EU Charter, purpose limitation, data subject rights, DPIAs, DPOs, DPAs, enforcement, data transfers, damages, LED, etc.) to dpsn@posteo.eu before 1st December 2022 midnight (CET). Closer to the date we will circulate a registration link and further details.
