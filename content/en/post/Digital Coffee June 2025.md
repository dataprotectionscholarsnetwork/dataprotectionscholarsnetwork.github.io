This isn’t a lecture — it’s a space to exchange views, discuss, ask questions, and think together about where the data protection law is heading. 
Whether you're an academic, legal professional, data protection officer, or simply curious about the field, your voice matters. Come share your perspectives and be part of the conversation.
 
**In this session, we will discuss CJEU Judgment in joined cases C‑313/23, C‑316/23 and C‑332/23 (Inspectorate at the Supreme Judicial Council, Bulgaria) on the GDPR and judicial authorisations to lift banking secrecy, particularly concerning the disclosure of data related to the bank accounts of judges and public prosecutors.**
 
The case will be introduced by Dr. Juraj Sajfert (post-doctoral researcher at the VUB).
 
We are meeting on Wednesday, June 4th, at 1.30 pm CET via MS Teams.
 
Everyone is welcome to join and contribute their insights!
