**On 28 January 2022, coinciding with the international Data Protection Day, the Data Protection Law Scholars Network organises **the first ever international quick meet-up of data protection law researchers**. 
The event will take place online, at 13:00-15:10 Brussels time**.  

### Format/What to expect

Speakers were selected through a call for abstracts for very short presentations that the Network launched back in December 2021. 
**Data protection law scholars of all levels of seniority will present *in 3 slides and 5 minutes* their current work**, be it a developing PhD, an interesting master thesis, an upcoming promising paper or a brand-new project.
The programme encompasses **two sessions, each one consisting of two parallel streams** with an equal number of speakers.  
The streams are not thematically organised but rather cover diverse and innovative topics of data protection law.  
The programme has a further element of surprise, meaning that we will not announce the names of the speakers per session, but **attendees will be allocated randomly either to Parallel Stream 1 or to Parallel Stream 2**. 
Throughout the event, participants will be actively encouraged to communicate with each other and network.

### How can I register/attend the event?

The event is **free to attend, but registration is required**. You can register [here](https://tilburguniversity.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJUufuqqqj0uH9fAlTy3-KC2Kw35nA2TRAgY).
