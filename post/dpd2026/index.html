The previous International Researchers Online Meet-up events were extremely successful. With this in mind,
we are once again calling for expressions of interest to do very short presentations of your research – be it your developing PhD,
interesting master thesis, upcoming promising paper, or brand-new project. All levels of seniority are welcome,
the only requirement is being to be open to listening to others in a rigorous yet friendly spirit.
Like the previous International Researchers Online Meet-up events, the participants will be asked to give a short presentation of a maximum of 5 minutes using no more than 3 slides.
A short Q&amp;A session (5 mins) will follow each presentation.</p><p>To participate in the January 2026 event, please send:</p><ol><li>Your (the presenter’s) name (please provide the name of all authors if you intend to present a co-authored paper or other work),</li><li>Your affiliation (please provide the affiliation information of all authors if you intend to present a co-authored paper or other work),</li><li>The title of your presentation,</li><li>A very short abstract (maximum 2 sentences) and 6 keywords (e.g., risk assessments, data spaces, generative AI, legal basis of processing)
to <a href=mailto:dpscholars@protonmail.com>dpscholars@protonmail.com</a> <strong>before December 22nd, 2025 midnight (CET).</strong>
Please be notified that the applications that fail to include all the required information shall not be considered.</li></ol><p><strong>Given the high number of applicants we received in the previous years and the limited number of presentations we can accommodate, we may have to reject some of the applications
to ensure diversity (gender, nationality, institutional affiliation, previous presentation etc.) among speakers and topics.</strong></p><p>The selected presentations will be notified shortly after the closure of the registrations, and the presenters will be asked to provide their 3 slides on January 23rd, 2026, at noon CET at the latest.
<strong>Due to practical limitations, the presenters who fail to submit their slides by this deadline will be removed from the program despite the confirmation email they receive.</strong></p><h2 id=do-you-want-to-receive-news-and-updates-and-share-your-own-news-with-other-data-protection-law-scholars>Do you want to receive news and updates and share your own news with other data protection law scholars?</h2><p>You can always follow our <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/company/data-protection-law-scholars-network-dpsn>LinkedIn Page</a>.
