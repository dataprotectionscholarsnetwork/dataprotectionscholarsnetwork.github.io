Panel: Data protection law scholars of the world, unite! (in little groups?) Towards a global data protection network?
In light of the growing importance of data protection laws across the world, there is an increased need for robust international expert networks in the field. Data protection authorities have been meeting regularly for decades already, in a variety of regional and global events (cf. the ICDPPC, now the Global Privacy Assembly), and there is also a significant rise in networks of privacy professional, synchronizing in numerous and dynamic structures (e.g. IAPP). To our knowledge, however, there are no real equivalent networks in the academic community, at least on the same scale. Indeed, despite some notable exceptions such as the Asian Privacy Scholars Network (APSN), there exist no international networks of scholars devoted to furthering research and education on data protection law. Thus, scholars working in the field lack equivalent networks through which to exchange information, be in contact with each other, and reach to and support newcomers. Can this be changed? Taking as a starting point the launch of the Data Protection Scholars Network, in Europe, this panel aims at discussing:"><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.140.0"><meta name=robots content="index, follow"><link rel=stylesheet href=/ananke/css/main.min.d05fb5f317fcf33b3a52936399bdf6f47dc776516e1692e412ec7d76f4a5faa2.css><link rel=canonical href=https://dataprotectionscholars.network/post/cpdp_latam_panel2021/><meta property="og:url" content="https://dataprotectionscholars.network/post/cpdp_latam_panel2021/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Data Protection Scholars Network"><meta property="og:title" content="The DPSN at CPDP LatAm 2021"><meta property="og:description" content="We are very glad to participate with a panel to the Conference CPDP LatAm 2021 taking place from July 14th to 16th 2021.
