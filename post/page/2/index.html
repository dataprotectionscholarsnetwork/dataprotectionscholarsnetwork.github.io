The Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL),
China&rsquo;s counterpart to the GDPR, was also created under the EU’s regulatory gravity. After one and a half years of enforcement of the PIPL,
questions have risen as to how well the imported regulatory tools have settled into China’s reality and how it has impacted the digital industry and individuals both domestic and global.
Against the backdrop of the growing call for reform of the EU data protection law, how will China react to similar regulatory challenges such as the ineffectiveness of informed consent and the influence of the powerful internet giants?</p></div><a href=/post/brussels-effect-in-china-event/ class="ba b--moon-gray bg-light-gray br2 color-inherit dib f7 hover-bg-moon-gray link mt2 ph2 pv1">read more</a></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="mb3 pa4 mid-gray overflow-hidden"><div class=f6>May 25, 2023</div><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/post/dpsn-at-cpdp2023/ class="link black dim">The State of Data Protection Law Academia</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height"><h2 id=on-the-25th-of-may-2023-the-data-protection-law-scholars-network-dpsn-will-participate-at-computers-privacy--data-protection-cpdp-2023><strong>On the 25th of May 2023, the Data Protection Law Scholars Network (DPSN) will participate at Computers, Privacy & Data Protection (CPDP) 2023</strong></h2><p>This will be an in-person event scheduled for May 25th (Thursday) between 17:15 and 18:30 at M-Village Grande.</p><p>As you may have noticed, a couple of weeks ago we published a word cloud to solicit the active participation of our entire community and identify the most pressing issues in the academic world of data protection.
