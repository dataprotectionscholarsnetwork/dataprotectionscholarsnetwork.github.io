Gstrein</h2><p>Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) are a useful method to spark an interdisciplinary discussion about the collection, storage, management and sharing of personal data. While the GDPR makes them mandatory in certain scenarios of data use, the methodology to implement them varies. In this session we explore ways to teach how to do a DPIA, especially in interdisciplinary teaching settings and scenarios where emerging technologies play a role. The material presented in this session is based on the COMENIUS project Privacy in Research, which was developed by Esther Hoorn at the University of Groningen in The Netherlands.</p><p>The session will be presented by Oskar J. Gstrein. Oskar is Assistant Professor at the interdisciplinary faculty Campus Fryslân/University of Groningen and serves as Programme Director of the Bachelor programme Data Science & Society. Oskar&rsquo;s overall research theme is &lsquo;Human Dignity in the Digital Age&rsquo;.</p><p>If you would like to join, please sign up for the seminar <a href=https://tilburguniversity.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJUrcOGspjkoE9FrF28RoT25RThl5EdSdE_Q>here</a> by the 2nd of November.</p><h2 id=2nd-december-1500--1600-brussels-time-conducting-interviews-for-socio-legal-research-with-ari-ezra-waldman>2nd December 15:00 – 16:00 Brussels Time: Conducting interviews for socio-legal research with Ari Ezra Waldman</h2><p>How to interview lawyers and experts?
